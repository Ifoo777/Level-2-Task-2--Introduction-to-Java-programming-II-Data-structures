# Level-2-Task-2--Introduction-to-Java-programming-II-Data-structure# Level 2 Task 2 -Introduction to Java programming II: Data structures

## Task 1

Follow these steps:

● Create a new file called IQ.java

● Create an array called ‘testResults’ that stores a list of results that 5 people have scored on an IQ test.

● Write the code that will calculate the average IQ of the five people based on the results in my ‘testResults’.

● Based on the average IQ, decide which description should be assigned.

Use the table below:

IQ score Description

130+ Very superior

120-129 Superior

110-119 High average

90-109 Average

80-89 Low average

70-79 Borderline

69 and below Extremely low

## Task 2

Follow these steps:

● Create a new file called multipleElements.java

● Write a program that creates a multi-dimensional array with the first 2 multiples of the numbers in the first row.

● Firstly, ask the user to enter four numbers. These will inhabit the first row of your array.

● The next two rows will be the first two multiples of the numbers above them. For example, if the user inputs 1, 2, 3 and 4, the 3-by-4 array will look like this:

1 2 3 4

2 4 6 8

3 6 9 12

● Print out the array.

## Task 3

Follow these steps:

● Create a new file called longWords.java

● Write a program that determines how many words greater than 4 letters long have been entered and calculate the average length of all the words entered.

● Firstly, ask the user to enter any number of words and store them in an array. The user should enter 0 to indicate the end of their input.

● The program should then determine the number of words longer than 4 letters entered by the user, and print out the result.

● The average length of the words given should then be calculated and displayed.
